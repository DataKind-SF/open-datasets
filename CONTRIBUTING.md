# Contribution Guidelines

If you come across a dataset that falls under one of listed categories, please add it and open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)!

#### Guidelines
* Check to make sure that your contribution is not a duplicate of a dataset that is already listed.
* Check to make sure that the dataset you are adding is free and open to the public.
* New datasets should each be listed under its own bullet, in the following format (in GitHub-flavored Markdown):

```Markdown
* [Name](link) - _Description_
```
For example:

```Markdown
* [U.S. Dept of Education - Civil Rights Data Collection](http://bit.ly/2CZH8sE) - _Data on enrollment, staffing, test scores, etc._
```

* The name of your dataset should be in [Title Case](http://titlecapitalization.com/).
* Please keep the description short but descriptive. Italicize for readability.
* Use [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) to shorten the URL link to your dataset.
