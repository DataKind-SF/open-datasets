# Open Datasets: Urban Poverty

The following is a collection of public datasets relating to poverty. They are intended for use  by data scientists, policymakers, community stakeholders to investigate and address poverty-related issues within their respective communities.

A variety of socio-economic factors may contribute to urban poverty, including but not limited to: cost of living, housing and shelter, education, public health, food insecurity, and support services.
